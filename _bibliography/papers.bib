  abstract={Using 2013 through 2020 survey waves of individual-level data from the CDCs Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the staggered adoption of “Tobacco 21” laws  across the United States, this paper examines the average treatment eﬀect of an increase in tobacco-purchasing-age on underage drinking. This analysis finds that overall, Tobacco 21 policy largely has an inconclusive or null impact on youth smoking participation. Though results for New Jersey and Oregon suggest that alcohol and tobacco are complements for youth in those states, Tobacco 21 policy induces less smoking and drinking in one state and more in another.},
